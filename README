WHAT IS STAGES?
It is an attempt at providing a new visual method for managing milestones on Basecamp. 
We aim to give quick visual feedback without falling into a GANTT like waterfall.

CONTRIBUTE?
Yes, please do. We have commented all the code in-line but if you have questions please feedback via github.
